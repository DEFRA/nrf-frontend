# Context for AI agents

This project uses a [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) file to share context for AI tools like Claude Code and Cursor, rather than duplicating context and rules to separate CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files. There is a [CLAUDE.md](../.claude/CLAUDE.md) but it just links to the AGENTS.md and is only there to ensure the context is read by Claude Code, as it doesn't yet support AGENTS.md directly.
